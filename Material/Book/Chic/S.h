  /** Most atomic functions of mini-lisp are implemented as a collection of
   * fluentons: these are methods provided by type S and specifically designed
   * to make it possible to write Mini-Lisp expressions in the fluent-, rather
   * than the list- or nested style. To demonstrate, consider the definition of
   * the Mini-Lisp library function lookup to conduct a search in a given
   * a-list:
   
(defun lookup (id a-list) 
  (cond 
    ((null a-list) 
      (error 'unbound-variable id))
    ((eq id (car (car a-list))) 
      (car (cdr (car a-list)))) 
    (t (lookup id (cdr a-list))))) 

With the fluentons of type S, this function is written as 

S lookup(S id, S a_list) { return 
  a_list.null() ?  id.error(UNDEFINED_ATOM) : 
     a_list.car().car().eq(id) ?  a_list.car().cdr() : 
        lookup(id, a_list.cdr()); }

A fluenton is a method designed to be used in expressions such as the above, in
which instead of writing '(cdr (car a))' in 'cdr(car(a))', we write
a.car().cdr(). Most fluentons return an S, that can be fluently continued by a
another fluenton. Some fluentons are sinks: they return a boolean that can be
used in a conditional expression,but  

Fluentons which do not implement an atomic function of mini-Lisp are called
auxiliary fluentons.
