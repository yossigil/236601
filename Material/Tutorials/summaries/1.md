# Tutorial 1

Aftermath:

- Functions are values.
- Types are not values.
- 'fn' .. '=>' is an operator!!!
- Values can be anonymous
- Types can be anonymous.
- Variables? Huh? Huh? Huh?
- Ovderloading??? When the same name refers to two values, of different types, and the parser/evaluator chooses the correct one based on type:
- Example: builtin `+` in ML denotes two functions:  `int * int -> int` and `real *real -> real`
  - A mishap, not working properly!
  - Cannot reproduce by user.
  - Hiding is not overloading. `int f() { int i = 3; { extern double i(int); } }`
  - Rebinding is not overloading: `val a = 2; val a = true;` and it is not assignment
